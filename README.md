Repo to update NWB files associated with the NP Ultra Psychedelics project. The code sources information from the VAST directory with the NP Ultra Psychedelics data and generates a new analysis table, stimulus table, and epoch table. These tables are added to the existing NWB file, then stored in a new directory on VAST. 
Access to VAST is required.
